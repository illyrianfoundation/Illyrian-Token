# Illyrian Token Overview

## Summary
Illyrian Token (ILLYRIAN) is a digital value asset built on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20).  
It is designed to maintain a stable on-chain reference value of **1 ILYRIAN = 1 USDT**, anchored through a controlled liquidity model and whitelist-based transaction framework.

## Core Principles
- **Closed liquidity model:** Transfers and swaps are limited to verified or whitelisted wallets.
- **Stable 1:1 parity:** The liquidity pool pairs ILYRIAN and USDT equally to maintain a visible $1 valuation on-chain and in wallets.
- **Administrative transparency:** Owner-only management for minting, liquidity setup, and compliance actions.
- **Immutable supply structure:** Fixed total supply of 100 billion tokens, minted at genesis.

## Utility
- Acts as a digital anchor for stable value representation.
- Enables controlled distribution through website and verified off-chain sales.
- Serves as a foundation for Illyrian Foundation’s ecosystem (future payment integrations, asset vaults, and digital licensing).
